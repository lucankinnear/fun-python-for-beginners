# Day 1 – Getting Started with Python 🐍

## What we will cover
- What Python is and where it’s used
- Installing Python and VS Code
- Running Python scripts
- Basic input and output using `print()` and `input()`

## Quick explanation
Python is a general-purpose programming language known for being readable and beginner-friendly.  
A Python program runs from top to bottom, executing each line in order.

To interact with users:
- `print()` displays output
- `input()` pauses the program and waits for user input

## Common beginner mistakes
- Expecting `input()` to return a number
- Forgetting to run the file after saving
- Panicking when an error appears instead of reading it

## Best practices
- Run small scripts often
- Read error messages carefully
- Keep programs simple while learning

## Setup and self-learning note

This course focuses on **learning Python by doing**, not on detailed installation walkthroughs.

For the following topics, you are expected to **look them up and follow official or trusted guides**:

- What Python is and where it’s used  
- Installing Python and VS Code  
- Running Python scripts  

### Why you should Google this
- Software tools change frequently
- Official documentation is always up to date
- Developers solve problems by researching, not memorising steps
- Learning how to search and evaluate solutions is a core programming skill

Use clear search terms like:
- `What is Python used for`
- `How to install Python on Windows`
- `How to run a Python file in VS Code`

If you can successfully install Python, open VS Code, and run a simple script, you are already practising real-world developer behaviour.

Once setup is complete, continue with the exercises.
