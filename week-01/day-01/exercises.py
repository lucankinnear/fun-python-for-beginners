Exercise 1: Reality check (2 minutes)

Goal: Make sure Python actually runs.
In VS Code, create a file called:
test.py
Type one line only:
print("Python is working")
Run it.

Exercise 2: Input → output loop (3 minutes)

Goal: Cement how input() actually behaves.
Write a script that:
Asks for a name
Prints a greeting using that name

Rules:
Use input() once
Use print() once
No fancy formatting

Example interaction (don’t copy this literally):

What is your name? Alex
Hello Alex


Exercise 3: Tiny bug hunt (3 minutes)

Goal: Learn to read errors early.
Look at this code without running it yet:
print("What is your age?")
age = input()
print("You are " + age + " years old")

Question:
Will this run without errors?
(Yes or no. Don’t guess. Think.)
Then run it and confirm.


Exercise 4: One-line change (2 minutes)

Goal: Start thinking ahead.
Modify Exercise 2 so the output looks like:
Nice to meet you, Alex!
Only change one line.

Best practices to lock in today
Keep these in your head, not memorised:

input() always returns a string
Python scripts run top to bottom
If nothing prints, your code still ran
Errors are information, not failure

Mental check (important)

Answer these in your head:

What does print() do?
What does input() return?
How do you run a Python file in VS Code?

If you can answer those calmly, today’s lesson is cemented.
