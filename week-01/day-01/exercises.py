Exercise 1: Reality check (2 minutes)

Goal: Make sure Python actually runs.

👉 In VS Code, create a file called:

test.py


Type one line only:

print("Python is working")


Run it.

Checkpoint question:
Did the text print in the terminal without errors?
(Yes or no. If no, that’s the gap.)



Exercise 2: Input → output loop (3 minutes)

Goal: Cement how input() actually behaves.

Write a script that:

Asks for a name

Prints a greeting using that name

Rules:

Use input() once

Use print() once

No fancy formatting

Example interaction (don’t copy this literally):

What is your name? Alex
Hello Alex



Exercise 3: Tiny bug hunt (3 minutes)

Goal: Learn to read errors early.

Look at this code without running it yet:

print("What is your age?")
age = input()
print("You are " + age + " years old")


👉 Question:
Will this run without errors?
(Yes or no. Don’t guess. Think.)

Then run it and confirm.



Exercise 4: One-line change (optional, 2 minutes)

Goal: Start thinking ahead.

Modify Exercise 2 so the output looks like:

Nice to meet you, Alex!


Only change one line.


Best practices to lock in today

Keep these in your head, not memorised:

input() always returns a string
Python scripts run top to bottom
If nothing prints, your code still ran
Errors are information, not failure

Before bed mental check (important)

Answer these in your head:

What does print() do?
What does input() return?
How do you run a Python file in VS Code?

If you can answer those calmly, today’s lesson is cemented.
